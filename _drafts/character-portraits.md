For now, I'm planning to release a devblog weekly. I'll be very transparent with my development process, outlining my design ideas and development strategies. Pixel animation, programming patterns, sound design, it'll all be here! If that interests you, I'll be updating the blog every monday!

If you got any questions/wanna tell me sumthin:
- email: **kevinjin729@gmail.com**
- or, if that's not your style: friend me on discord **@wabubby**
