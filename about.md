Hi! I'm **Kevin Jin**(known aliases: Radagast, Wabubby), and I'm currently developing my first game **Super Ant**, a fast-paced metroidvania where you punch the blood out of monsters on an alien planet. You can read a still short but better decription in [THE FIRST ARTICLE](\articles\what-is-superant).

I'm currently studying computer science at university. I like baking, my favourite food is shepherd's pie, my favourite colours are <b span style="color: #ff3399ff;">this one</b> and <b span style="color: #acd341ff;">that one</b>, and my favourite games are [Slay the Spire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/), [Noita](https://store.steampowered.com/app/881100/Noita/), [Caves of Qud](https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/), and [ULTRAKILL](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/).

You can navigate to the [All Articles Page](\articles) for devlogs and tutorials about software, pixel art, and game design.
