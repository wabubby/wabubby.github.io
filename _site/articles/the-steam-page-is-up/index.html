        <p>It took just over a week, but the steam page is up! If you’re planning to release a game, it’s good to get this up as early so you have something to point to as well to start accruing those tasty tasty wishlists. So, uh, wishlist SUPER ANT on steam!</p>

<p>[[link to superant and picture of the game]]</p>

<p>Since I’ve never distributed an app on steam before, it all started with getting my <strong>steam partnership</strong> verified. Just give them all your personal, financial, and tax information and you’re good to go in two days.</p>

<p>There used to be a whole greenlighting process on steam many moons ago, but now <strong>distributing an app</strong> is as simple as giving Steam 100 green johns. Luckily, the steam partnership fee you pay at the beginning gives you your first app voucher for “free”!</p>

<p>Now came the fun part of setting up my store page. To expedite this process, I wrote <strong>game descriptions</strong> and made <strong>graphical assets</strong> while waiting for my steam partnership to arrive. Steam expects <strong>8 different capsule images</strong> all with various dimensions. To do this quickly, make one full-sized, layered asset which you can recompose over and over into these different dimensions.</p>

<p>These banners are very important, as they will be the first thing <strong>the market</strong> sees. After playing a couple rounds of Jonas Tyroller’s [[Steam Review Guesser]], my good lad Sniper_Slayers and I spent 2 hours examining 90 different capsule arts. Combat-oriented games are north of the axis.</p>

<h1 id="elements-of-a-excellent-capsule">Elements of a Excellent Capsule</h1>

<p>Of course, art is subjective, but we found the <strong>best combat banners</strong> to be those that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>followed the typical <strong>title and protaganist on either side</strong> composition rather than a centered composition or purely text. It’s very much possible to make a different composition work, but left-right works very well for sole protaganists.</li>
</ul>

  <figcaption><i><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/588650/Dead_Cells/">One of many examples.</a></i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>protaganist should be performing an action.</strong> This should convey what kind of character they are as well as the theme and intention. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/863550/HITMAN_2/">Agent 47</a> draws out a concealed gun, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1174180/Red_Dead_Redemption_2/">Arthur Morgan</a> is in a standoff, and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/311690/Enter_the_Gungeon/">Gungeon Crawlers</a> are blasting away.</li>
</ul>

  </div>
  <figcaption><i>Action conveys theme.</i></figcaption>
</figure>
<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>protaganist should stand out</strong> with one or many techniques. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/863550/HITMAN_2/">Hitman</a> has got an excellent <strong>sihlouette</strong>. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257850/Hyper_Light_Drifter/">The Drifter</a> has got <strong>rim-lighting</strong>. Using strong <strong>gesture</strong>, <strong>size</strong>, <strong>backlighting</strong> and <strong>color-contrast</strong> all make the image pop.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>the <strong>fontface</strong>, <strong>character design</strong>, and <strong>colors palette</strong> will all work to communicate the tone and mechanics of your game. Difficult games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/374320/DARK_SOULS_III/">soulslikes</a> typically have dark backgrounds. Games with <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/860950/Mark_of_the_Ninja_Remastered/">eastern settings</a> typically have brushstroke titles, while <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/">sci-fi</a> games should obviously feature sans-serif. Make your <strong>protaganist design</strong> thematically evocative, as they serve as the <strong>mascot and promotional material</strong> for the majority of games.</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p><br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>If your <strong>game’s art style is a selling point</strong>, put it front and center. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/">Obra-dinn</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/">Factorio</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/">Islanders</a>, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/262060/Darkest_Dungeon/">Darkest Dungeon</a> are all good examples of games whose visual style market themselves. My game’s art is very simple, so this doesn’t apply to me.</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Besides content-creators</strong>, I’m pretty sure that the <strong>Steam Page is the most important</strong> marketing device, so take your time and get it right. I’ll end off with a look at my own capsule art.</p>

<p>This is my first time drawing something this big or complicated, so it took me a damn while. The title pops out. The chromatic <strong>aberrration on the blood gives movement</strong> to the image. The character <strong>design emphasizes the punching</strong> nature of game and the <strong>red stands out</strong> well on the <strong>blue background</strong>. There’s not too much color or detail so it’s <strong>readable at a small size</strong>.</p>

<p>However, I think the <strong>pose could be more dynamic</strong>, perhaps with more perspective or if I knew how to draw legs better. The spacing is little awkward on some capsules, and there wasn’t enough space to fit enemies on most compositions.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, it came out better than I thought it would so I’m pretty pleased.</p>

<p>And remember readers, <strong>WISHLIST SUPER ANT on Steam</strong>!</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Tip Summary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>prepare your assets while waiting for verification to get it done faster.</li>
  <li>make one layered graphical asset which you can compose into all the required capsules.</li>
  <li>keep your descriptions short. pictures are worth more than words, and gifs are worth more than stills.</li>
  <li>your game capsules are the face of the game. align the title, protaganist, and action in accord with your games mechanics and themes.</li>
</ul>
